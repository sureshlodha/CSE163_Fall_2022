It’s unusual among Empidonax flycatchers for having only an indistinct pale eyering, a trait it shares with the very similar Willow Flycatcher. Alder Flycatchers thrive in open settings such as bogs and beaver ponds, where they sit on high perches and fly out to catch insects from nearby leaves or in midair."
American Avocet,ameavo,"Distinctive large shorebird with a long, thin upturned bill and lean neck. Bold black-and-white wings prominent year-round. Adults in summer have buffy-orange wash on head.

This long-legged wader glides through shallow waters swishing its slender, upturned bill from side to side to catch aquatic invertebrates. It dons a sophisticated look for summer with a black-and-white body and a rusty head and neck. During the winter the head and neck turn a grayish white, but the bird loses none of its elegance as it forages along coastal waters or rests while standing on one leg."
American Bittern,amebit,"Stocky, brown heron found in marshes and bogs; secretive but occasionally found in the open. Most similar to juvenile night-herons. Note striped neck, plain unspotted wings, and behavior: American Bittern does not typically perch on branches. Varied diet includes fish, frogs, insects, and small mammals. Most active around dawn and dusk flying low over extensive marshes.

This streaky, brown and buff heron can materialize among the reeds, and disappear as quickly, especially when striking a concealment pose with neck stretched and bill pointed skyward. These stealthy carnivores stand motionless amid tall marsh vegetation, or patiently stalk fish, frogs, and insects. They are at their most noticeable in spring, when the marshes resound with their odd booming calls that sounds like the gulps of a thirsty giant."
American Crow,amecro,"Entirely black. Large, long-legged, thick-necked bird with heavy, straight bill. In flight, wings are fairly broad and rounded with wingtip feathers spread like fingers. Short tail, squared off at the end. Very social, sometimes forming noisy flocks in the thousands. Aggressive, often chase away hawks and owls. Common in fields, woods, and cities.

They are common sights in treetops, fields, and roadsides, and in habitats ranging from open woods and empty beaches to town centers. They usually feed on the ground and eat almost anything—typically earthworms, insects and other small animals, seeds, and fruit; also garbage, carrion, and chicks they rob from nests. Their flight style is unique, a patient, methodical flapping that is rarely broken up with glides."
American Goldfinch,amegfi,"Small finch. Sharply pointed bill is pink in summer, grayish-brown in winter. Small head, long wings, and short, notched tail. Adult males in spring and summer are bright yellow with black forehead and wings. Females are dull yellow below and olive above with two distinct wingbars. In winter, they are drab, buffy-brown. Active and acrobatic. Sometimes in large numbers at feeders or on ground below.

Goldfinches often flock with Pine Siskins and Common Redpolls. Spring males are brilliant yellow and shiny black with a bit of white. Females and all winter birds are more dull but identifiable by their conical bill; pointed, notched tail; wingbars; and lack of streaking. During molts they look bizarrely patchy."
American Kestrel,amekes,"Petite falcon roughly the same size as Mourning Dove, but with a larger head and wider tail. In flight, note long, narrow wings and square-tipped tail. Often seen perched on telephone wires, along roadsides, in open country with short vegetation and few trees. From a perch or hovering, they usually drop to the ground to snatch small mammals and insects. Nests in cavities. Widespread across the Americas.

It's one of the most colorful of all raptors: the male’s slate-blue head and wings contrast elegantly with his rusty-red back and tail; the female has the same warm reddish on her wings, back, and tail. Hunting for insects and other small prey in open territory, kestrels perch on wires or poles, or hover facing into the wind, flapping and adjusting their long tails to stay in place. Kestrels are declining in parts of their range; you can help them by putting up nest boxes"
American Pipit,amepip,"Slender and drab songbird of open country. Usually grayish above and streaked below, but some lack streaks in breeding season. Distinguished from similar-looking (unrelated) sparrows by thin bill and lanky appearance with long legs. Walks on the ground with jerky motions and frequently bobs tail. Flocks are often heard as they pass overhead or flush from a barren field.

Although they’re found in the open and are not especially shy, these small birds can still be inconspicuous as they walk briskly through tundra or agricultural fields. They also forage along river and lake shores, much in the manner of a shorebird. If you don’t live in the Arctic or above treeline, look for these birds in winter."
American Redstart,amered,"Adult males are black with bright orange wings, tail, and sides. Much smaller and more active than other black-and-orange birds like orioles. Females and immature males have gray head, olive back, and yellow patches instead of orange. This warbler forages in trees and bushes, habitually flicking its tail and wings to scare up insects. Breeds in deciduous forests (mature and secondary growth). Winters in Central and South America.

True to its Halloween-themed color scheme, the redstart seems to startle its prey out of the foliage by flashing its strikingly patterned tail and wing feathers. Females and immature males have more subdued yellow “flash patterns” on a gray background. These sweet-singing warblers nest in open woodlands across much of North America."
American Robin,amerob,"Fairly large songbird with round body, long legs, and longish tail. Gray above with warm orange underparts and blackish head. Hops across lawns and stands erect with its bill often tilted upward. In fall and winter, forms large flocks and gathers in trees to roost or eat berries. Common across North America in gardens, parks, yards, golf courses, fields, pastures, and many other wooded habitats.

Robins are popular birds for their warm orange breast, cheery song, and early appearance at the end of winter. Though they’re familiar town and city birds, American Robins are at home in wilder areas, too, including mountain forests and Alaskan wilderness."
American Wigeon,amewig,"Longer-tailed than Mallard with thinner, pale blue bill. Breeding males have prominent white blaze on forehead and broad green slash behind eye. Look for orangey sides on females. As comfortable grazing on land as dabbling in water. Often steals food from diving ducks as they surface.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/60017891/900,NA,Brown,Mareca americana,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Ducks,Lakes and Ponds,Plants,Ground,Dabbler,Low Concern,"Quiet lakes and wetlands come alive with the breezy whistle of the American Wigeon, a dabbling duck with pizzazz. Breeding males have a green eye patch and a conspicuous white crown, earning them the nickname ""baldpate."" Females are brushed in warm browns with a gray-brown head and a smudge around the eye. Noisy groups congregate during fall and winter, plucking plants with their short gooselike bill from wetlands and fields or nibbling plants from the water's surface. Despite being common their populations are declining."
American Woodcock,amewoo,"Plump, camouflaged shorebird that favors wooded or shrubby areas often next to fields. Rarely seen well in daytime. Generally gray above with darker stripes running down back, pale-orange belly, and dark markings on head. Exceptionally long bill, ideal for pulling up worms.

Unlike its coastal relatives, this plump little shorebird lives in young forests and shrubby old fields across eastern North America. Its cryptic plumage and low-profile behavior make it hard to find except in the springtime at dawn or dusk, when the males show off for females by giving loud, nasal peent calls and performing dazzling aerial displays."
American Tree Sparrow,amtspa,"Hardy northern sparrow with plump body, small bill and long, thin tail. Note rusty cap and rusty (not black) eyeline, gray head and unstreaked grayish breast with dark smudge in center. Small flocks hop on ground, foraging for seeds, giving a soft, musical twitter. In winter, look for them in weedy fields with shrubs, forest edges, and marshes. Readily visit backyards.

Hopping up at bent weeds or even beating their wings to dislodge seeds from grass heads, they scratch and peck the ground in small flocks, trading soft, musical twitters. Come snowmelt, these small rusty-capped and smooth-breasted sparrows begin their long migrations to breeding grounds in the tundra of the far North."
Anna's Hummingbird,annhum,"Relatively large-headed and chunky. Gray and green overall, lacking rufous, buff, or orange. Males have shocking magenta head, which appears dark when not catching the light. Found in fairly open areas, including woodlands, desert scrub, and chaparral. The only hummingbird that regularly winters in northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

With their iridescent emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throats, they are more like flying jewelry than birds. Though no larger than a ping-pong ball and no heavier than a nickel, Anna’s Hummingbirds make a strong impression. In their thrilling courtship displays, males climb up to 130 feet into the air and then swoop to the ground with a curious burst of noise that they produce through their tail feathers."
Ash-throated Flycatcher,astfly,"Fairly large flycatcher, larger than a phoebe but smaller than a robin. Generally found in arid habitats with tall shrubs. Note the rather long, slender shape and often peaked crown. Plumage looks washed out; whitish throat, very pale yellow belly, and dull brown on top. Also look for rufous in the tail and wings. Distinguish from similar Great Crested Flycatcher by range, drab plumage, and voice.

Its subtle hues help it blend into its surroundings, but notes sputter out of its mouth all morning long, giving away its location. This genteel flycatcher tips its head side to side with seeming curiosity while perched among low oaks and mesquite trees. It is a die-hard bird of dry places that doesn't need to drink water; it gets all it needs from the insects and spiders it eats."
Baird's Sandpiper,baisan,"Long-winged, long-distance migrant similar to White-rumped Sandpiper but with warmer buffy-tan plumage. Elongated body gives a horizontal impression when foraging; unique flattened oval shape when seen head-on. Black bill and brown rump. Breeding adults rather pale with large black spots on back. Crisp juveniles show neat scaly pattern on wings and back and have a warm buffy face and neck. Often with flocks of other small shorebirds, but prefers drier habitats, such as the grassy edge of a mudflat, seaweed-covered upper portion of a beach, or sod field. Breeds in the Arctic tundra; winters in South America.

Their delicate buff and brown tones are warmer than the grayish brown of many other sandpipers, lending a softness to their plumage that makes them among the most recognizable species of the group. Baird’s Sandpipers are often nicknamed “grasspipers” because of their tendency to forage in drier, more vegetated habitats than many shorebirds."
Bald Eagle,baleag,"Majestic adults have blackish-brown body with white head and tail. Several stages of immature plumages aren't quite as majestic, from fully dark brown to messy and mottled with large patches of white. Look especially for white mottling on the belly on immatures. Scavenges and hunts near bodies of water. Soars with wings flat, like a large, dark plank. Head appears large in flight; projects far in front of wings.

These regal birds aren’t really bald, but their white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished under protection."
Baltimore Oriole,balori,"Males are stunning, orange with black head. Females vary from yellowish to bright orange below with grayish head. Blue-gray bill is sharply pointed. Often found high in deciduous trees in open woodlands, forest edges, orchards, riversides, parks, and backyards. Rich, whistling song, echoes from treetops. Phrases vary, but rich quality of whistled notes is always the same. Visits feeders with nectar and fruits. Sometimes hybridizes with Bullock's Oriole.

Look for them in chattering nesting colonies dug into the sides of sandy cliffs or banks, or pick them out of mixed swallow flocks as they catch insects over the water. These birds occur on all the continents except Australia and Antarctica—but in North America their numbers have mysteriously plummeted since 1970, and they are recognized as a Common Bird in Steep Decline."
Barn Swallow,barswa,"Recognizable even at a distance by its extremely long forked tail and dark rump. Spends a lot of time in flight, zipping over fields and ponds in search of insects. Appears dark above (iridescent navy blue in good light) and lighter below; belly color varies considerably across its extremely wide distribution, ranging from white to orange.

It nests in burrows along earthen banks and feeds almost entirely on aquatic prey, diving to catch fish and crayfish with its heavy, straight bill. These ragged-crested birds are a powdery blue-gray; males have one blue band across the white breast, while females have a blue and a chestnut band."
Bell's Sparrow,belspa2,"Brown sparrow with gray head; very similar to Sagebrush Sparrow and once considered the same species. Darker than Sagebrush Sparrow with slightly different face pattern. Look for relatively dark gray head with white eyering, white spot in front of eye, and white mustache bordered by broad black stripe. Flanks brownish with diffuse streaking; belly and breast white. Found in shrubby expanses of sagebrush. Perches conspicuously when singing; otherwise stays low and hidden. Tail often cocked up. In winter,  found with Sagebrush Sparrow.

The flashy black, white, and cinnamon males and the less flamboyant females sing from perches in suburbs, desert thickets, and mountain forests. At feeders they effortlessly shuck sunflower seeds with their heavy bills. The showy male puts in equal time on the domestic front: both sexes sit on the eggs, feed the young, and feistily defend their nesting territory."
Blackpoll Warbler,bkpwar,"Relatively large warbler of the boreal forest. Breeding males can be confused with Black-and-white Warbler. Note different head pattern; solid black cap and bright white cheek. Breeding females are a washed out, streakier version of male. Immatures are quite different: lemony-yellow head and breast with blurry streaking, white wingbars, and white undertail coverts. Distinctive orange feet helps distinguish Blackpoll from similar immature Bay-breasted and Pine Warblers. Found in any forested habitat during migration. Favors conifers, especially stunted spruce at higher elevations for breeding. Known for its exceptional migration over the Atlantic Ocean; can travel from East Coast of U.S. to South America in one nonstop flight!

This long-distance athlete weighs less than half an ounce yet makes the longest overwater journey of any songbird—nearly 1,800 miles nonstop over the Atlantic Ocean to its wintering grounds. In the fall, this black-and-white warbler molts into yellow-green plumage and loses its black cap. Although still numerous, it has lost an estimated 88% of its population in the last 40 years."
Black-throated Sparrow,bktspa,"Evidence that not all sparrows are dull, Black-throated Sparrow is a sharp-dressed denizen of open, shrubby desert. Gray-brown overall with distinctive black-and-white face pattern, dark tail with white corners. Streakier juvenile shows a hint of adult's face pattern, especially white eyebrow.

Black-throated Sparrows have neat gray faces set off by two bold white stripes and a neat black triangular patch on the throat. The face pattern jumps out when the bird is perched in the open, but at other times the soft brown back and pale underparts help it blend in with its desert home. You'll have to listen intently for little tinkling calls as these quiet birds forage on the ground for seeds and insects."
Black Phoebe,blkpho,"Small, sooty black flycatcher with clean white belly. Sits in the open on low perches to scan for insects, while pumping its tail up and down. Often near a water source whether it's a river, suburban creek, or salt-sprayed rocks and cliffs.

Though they’re still fairly common in grasslands, Bobolink numbers are declining."
Bonaparte's Gull,bongul,"Small, pale gull with white underparts and gray back. Thin, black bill. Often seen in flight. Note unique wing pattern: several outer primaries white with black tips. Red legs. Adults in breeding plumage show black head. Nonbreeding and immatures have white head with black spot behind eye. Immatures also show white primaries with blackish-brown markings on the upperwing. Often seen in large flocks in coastal areas, bays, coves, and lakes during migration and winter.

Double-crested Cormorant,doccor,"Dark body with orange bare skin at the base of the bill. Breeding adults are all black. Immatures and nonbreeders have paler breast. Dives underwater to catch fish. Swims like a duck in between dives. Finds open perches to spread wings and dry feathers. Can be in large flocks or solo. Most widespread cormorant across U.S. and Canada; also most likely to be seen inland.

Though they look like a combination of a goose and a loon, they are relatives of frigatebirds and boobies and are a common sight around fresh and salt water across North America—perhaps attracting the most attention when they stand on docks, rocky islands, and channel markers, their wings spread out to dry. These solid, heavy-boned birds are experts at diving to catch small fish."
Downy Woodpecker,dowwoo,"Tiny. Widespread and familiar woodland resident and backyard visitor.

An often acrobatic forager, this black-and-white woodpecker is at home on tiny branches or balancing on slender plant galls, sycamore seed balls, and suet feeders. Downies and their larger lookalike, the Hairy Woodpecker, are one of the first identification challenges that beginning bird watchers master."
Dusky Flycatcher,dusfly,"Dull grayish flycatcher, very similar to other flycatchers, especially Hammond's and Gray. Generally grayish with green-tinged back and pale yellow wash on belly. Wingtips shorter than Hammond's Flycatcher and typically found in brushier, more open habitats such as forest edge, but not as open and sparse as Gray Flycatcher.

Olive-gray above, with a bold eyering and two wingbars, Dusky wears the classic markings of an Empidonax flycatcher and can be hard to distinguish from other species. Dusky Flycatchers forage for flying insects but stay fairly low in the vegetation, frequently giving a short, sharp wit call."
Eared Grebe,eargre,"Small body with very thin bill. Head is peaked over red eye. Breeding adults have yellow whiskers on cheek for a fan-shaped patch, black back and mostly dark brown body. In winter, they have a gray body with a black cap, dusky wash across white cheek, and smudgy gray neck. Often in middle of large, open bodies of water.

These brown-and-white songbirds sit upright and wag their tails from prominent, low perches. They typically place their mud-and-grass nests in protected nooks on bridges, barns, and houses, which adds to the species’ familiarity to humans. Hardy birds, Eastern Phoebes winter farther north than most other flycatchers and are one of the earliest returning migrants in spring."
Eastern Towhee,eastow,"Large, striking, long-tailed sparrow of the eastern U.S. and Canada. Females are browner than jet-black males. White in the wing is limited to one small patch at the base of the primaries. Forages primarily by hopping along ground, scraping away leaf litter.

These small flycatchers perch on dead branches in the mid-canopy and sally out after flying insects. Though identifying flycatchers can be confusing, pewees are grayer overall, with longer wings, than other flycatchers. They lack the eyerings of the Empidonax species, while they’re less brown (with stronger wingbars) than a phoebe. With a careful look they’re quite distinctive."
Eurasian Collared-Dove,eucdov,"Smoothly-colored grayish-brown dove. Body is uniformly chalky-beige with a black crescent on the nape. Smaller and paler than Rock Pigeon, with a proportionally longer, square-tipped tail. Favors farms and suburbs and avoids areas with extensive forests.

They made their way to Florida by the 1980s and then rapidly colonized most of North America."
European Starling,eursta,"Stocky and dark overall. Short tail, triangular wings, and long, pointed bill. Close look reveals beautiful plumage. In breeding season, shows purple and green iridescence on body with yellow bill. In winter, bold white spots cover the entire body. Native to Eurasia; introduced in many regions worldwide, where it is now abundant. Often in large flocks. Makes variety of squeaky vocalizations, including proficient mimicry of other species.

Covered in white spots during winter, they turn dark and glossy in summer. For much of the year, they wheel through the sky and mob lawns in big, noisy flocks."
Evening Grosbeak,evegro,"Large finch, nearly twice the size of a goldfinch. Stocky with strong, thick, pale bill and short, notched tail. Males are stunning with dark head fading to bright yellow underparts, and mostly black wings with bright white secondaries. Females are overall gray with some white on the wing.

The yellow-bodied, dusky-headed male has an imposing air thanks to his massive bill and fierce eyebrow stripe. The female is more subtly marked, with golden highlights on her soft gray plumage. This declining species is becoming uncommon, particularly in the eastern United States."
Field Sparrow,fiespa,"Small sparrow can be either gray or buffy overall, but always note small pink bill, plain face, and thin white eyering. Inhabits overgrown fields and other brushy areas.

The singer is a small, warm-toned sparrow with a rusty cap, neat white eyering, and pink bill. Though still common, Field Sparrows have declined sharply in the last half-century, partly because of the expansion of suburbs, where Field Sparrows will not nest. Populations in the prairies have remained strong thanks in part to measures like the Conservation Reserve Program."

Named for the rich red hues that many Fox Sparrows wear, this species is nevertheless one of our most variable birds, with four main groups that can range from foxy red to gray to dark brown. Since they breed primarily in remote areas, many people see them in winter when the birds move into backyard thickets."
Gadwall,gadwal,"Same size as Mallard but with a thinner bill. Males appear gray overall with a small white patch on wing; larger, puffier head than Mallard. Females similar to Mallard; note thinner bill, white wing patch (sometimes visible) and orange line along the edge of the bill.

Seen up close, it is a striking bird with a velvet-green back, rich chestnut body, and a dark cap often raised into a short crest. These small herons crouch patiently to surprise fish with a snatch of their daggerlike bill. They sometimes lure in fish using small items such as twigs or insects as bait."
Great-tailed Grackle,grtgra,"Large, lanky blackbird with flat crown and long tail. Males have ridiculously long tails, almost as long as their body, often held in a V-shape. Males are glossy black. Females are brown with paler eyebrow and throat. Eyes yellow to white; dusky for immatures. In coastal Texas, where its range overlaps with Boat-tailed Grackle, note habitat (more generalized as opposed to strictly saltmarsh) and pale eye (not brown).

The rich brown females are about half the male’s size. Flocks of these long-legged, social birds strut and hop on suburban lawns, golf courses, fields, and marshes in Texas, the Southwest, and southern Great Plains. In the evening, raucous flocks pack neighborhood trees, filling the sky with their amazing (some might say ear-splitting) voices."
Gray Catbird,grycat,"Medium-sized songbird, smaller than a robin, with a smooth gray body, black cap, and rusty-red undertail. Sometimes mimics other species in complex, jumbled song.

Once you’ve heard its catty mew you won’t forget it. Follow the sound into thickets and vine tangles and you’ll be rewarded by a somber gray bird with a black cap and bright rusty feathers under the tail. Gray Catbirds are relatives of mockingbirds and thrashers, and they share that group’s vocal abilities, copying the sounds of other species and stringing them together to make their own song."
Gray Flycatcher,gryfly,"Drab, pale-gray flycatcher with little plumage contrast; very similar to other flycatchers, especially Dusky and Hammond's. Often best identified by unique habit of wagging tail downward. Breeding habitat also distinctive: lower, more open habitat than other flycatchers, usually in sagebrush or open juniper forest. In migration and winter, habitat overlaps more with other flycatchers, but still tends to prefer more open areas.

This flycatcher is a member of the notoriously difficult-to-identify genus Empidonax, but it has a telltale move that gives it away. The bird habitually dips its tail downward, recalling the way a phoebe wags its tail rather than the upward tail-flicking of some of its fellow Empidonax. Gray Flycatchers forage nimbly for insects in sagebrush, pine, and juniper habitats—often very low in the vegetation and sometimes on the ground."
Hairy Woodpecker,haiwoo,"Widespread and familiar woodland resident and backyard visitor.

Look for them at backyard suet or sunflower feeders, and listen for them whinnying from woodlots, parks, and forests."
Hammond's Flycatcher,hamfly,"Small grayish flycatcher, very similar to other flycatchers, especially Dusky and Gray. Subtle differences include smaller bill with limited pale base, slightly more peaked crown, and longer wingtips. Also note habitat during breeding season: Hammond's prefers mature conifers, often seen higher up in trees than Dusky. Habitat overlaps more with other flycatchers during migration and winter; found in a variety of brushy wooded habitats.

Males sing a very short, 3-parted song that can help distinguish this species from other similar Empidonax flycatchers, including the Dusky Flycatcher, which can occur in shrubby habitats adjacent to Hammond’s. Compared to other Empidonax, Hammond’s has a fairly small, dark bill and long wings. In its breeding habitat, Hammond’s often forages and nests rather high in trees."
Herring Gull,hergul,"Widespread and often common inland and on the coast. Adults have gray back with black wingtips. Takes four years for immatures to progress from mostly brown to white and gray; intermediate plumages are often mottled and messy. Varies incrementally across a wide geographic range. Scavenges shorelines, mudflats, plowed fields, and open ocean, picking up scraps wherever it can. Often congregates in large groups with other gulls, especially around fishing boats, beaches, piers, and landfills. Far-carrying yelping screams are a common sound of waterside habitats around the world.

The Hermit Thrush has a rich brown upper body and smudged spots on the breast, with a reddish tail that sets it apart from similar species in its genus."
Hooded Merganser,hoomer,"Small duck; feeds by diving to catch mainly fish with thin, serrated bill. Breeding males have showy black and white crest, a couple zebra stripes on their white breast, and chestnut sides. Females and immature males are brown overall with a puffy crest and a thin orange stripe along the bottom of the bill. Nests in cavities.

Adult males are a sight to behold, with sharp black-and-white patterns set off by chestnut flanks. Females get their own distinctive elegance from their cinnamon crest. Hooded Mergansers are fairly common on small ponds and rivers, where they dive for fish, crayfish, and other food, seizing it in their thin, serrated bills. They nest in tree cavities; the ducklings depart with a bold leap to the forest floor when only one day old."
Hooded Warbler,hoowar,"Rather small, yellow warbler that habitually flashes its white outer tail feathers. Males have distinctive black hood with yellow face; females duller with only a shadow of hood (some lack it completely). Most similar to Wilson's Warbler; always look for white in the tail on Hooded.

Females lack the bold black hood, but their yellow cheeks still stand out. Listen for their characteristic song on the breeding grounds and their metallic chip on the wintering grounds in Mexico and Central America."
Horned Grebe,horgre,"Compact body with thin bill. Breeding adults have long yellow tuft behind red eye, black cheek, and rusty body.

House Finch,houfin,"Frequents suburban settings across North America, along with open woods, brushy field edges, and deserts. Males vary in shades and intensity of red. Some males are yellow or orange. Females are drab gray-brown overall with plain faces and blurry streaks on underparts. Similar to Purple and Cassin's Finch, but House Finch males are more orangey-red with color equally bright on crown, throat, and breast. Red color is mostly restricted to head and upper chest, contrasting with cold gray-brown nape, back, and wings. Pale sides show distinct brown streaks, lacking red tones. Females lack bold face pattern and have more diffuse patterning overall. Often sings loudly in neighborhoods and visits feeders.

If you haven’t seen one recently, chances are you can find one at the next bird feeder you come across."
House Sparrow,houspa,"Widespread and abundant in cities, neighborhoods and farms. Avoids dense woods. Flocks cluster in dense bushes, bustling around and chattering to one another. Males have smart black bibs, bright rufous napes, and stunningly patterned wings with brilliant buffs and browns. Underparts are pale pearly-gray. Females are plain brown with cute face and lighter eyebrow. Native to Eurasia; introduced to much of the rest of the world.

It calls open pine forests, woodlands, and burned forests home, but it often wanders around nomadically outside of the breeding season in search of nuts."
Lincoln's Sparrow,linspa,"Slightly smaller than Song Sparrow, with finer streaking on breast. Also note thin pale eyering, bright buffy breast that contrasts with white belly, and often peaked crown. Prefers thickets and shrubby areas. Beware of juvenile Song Sparrows in late summer, which can look buffy and show finer streaks than adults. Infrequently visits feeders.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/64984571/900,NA,Brown,Melospiza lincolnii,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Sparrows,Scrub,Insects,Ground,Ground Forager,Low Concern,"The dainty Lincoln's Sparrow has a talent for concealing itself. It sneaks around the ground amid willow thickets in wet meadows, rarely straying from cover. When it decides to pop up and sing from a willow twig, its sweet, jumbling song is more fitting of a House Wren than a sparrow. Though its song might conceal its sparrowness, its plumage says otherwise. This sparrow looks as if it is wearing a finely tailored suit with a buffy mustachial stripe and delicate streaking down its buffy chest and sides."
Long-billed Curlew,lobcur,"Huge shorebird with incredibly long, downturned bill used to probe into mud and snag invertebrates. Buffy overall with brighter cinnamon wings.

This speckled, cinnamon-washed shorebird probes deep into mud and sand for aquatic invertebrates on its coastal wintering grounds and picks up grasshoppers on the breeding grounds. It breeds in the grasslands of the Great Plains and Great Basin and spends the winter in wetlands, tidal estuaries, mudflats, flooded fields, and beaches."
Long-billed Dowitcher,lobdow,"Plump, long-billed shorebird. Breeding adults have salmon-orange underparts with thin black and white bars on neck and sides. Very similar to Short-billed Dowitcher. Upperparts are darker than Short-billed Dowitcher; feathers have darker rufous markings and narrower white tips. Nonbreeding adult plain gray; plumage nearly identical to Short-billed.

These tubby, long-billed shorebirds plunge their bills deep into wet mud or sand to find invertebrate food. Flocks twitter at each other while feeding—a habit that sets them apart from the otherwise very similar Short-billed Dowitcher. In northern Alaska and Siberia, males court females with effervescent song flights."
Loggerhead Shrike,logshr,"Gray-bodied, black-masked bandit of open areas, both rural and suburban. Power lines and tops of bushes offer the perfect perches for shrikes to spot their prey. Carnivorous habits make shrikes unique among passerines. In flight, watch for white patches in the wings. Feeds on large insects, rodents and small birds.

A denizen of grasslands and other open habitats throughout much of North America, this masked black, white, and gray predator hunts from utility poles, fence posts and other conspicuous perches, preying on insects, birds, lizards, and small mammals. Lacking a raptor’s talons, Loggerhead Shrikes skewer their kills on thorns or barbed wire or wedge them into tight places for easy eating. Their numbers have dropped sharply in the last half-century."
Long-tailed Duck,lotduc,"Diving duck that favors saltwater in winter and Arctic tundra pools in summer. Males are distinctive with black, white, gray, and brown patterns and long pointed tail. Male plumage changes dramatically from winter to summer. Females and immature males are brownish overall with whiter face and large dark cheek patch.

In all plumages they have extravagantly long, slender tail feathers. Females and immatures are smudgy brown and white, without the long tail. These prodigious divers can feed as deep as 200 feet, swimming with their wings, catching invertebrates and small fish."
Louisiana Waterthrush,louwat,"Brown-and-white denizen of bubbling streams and brooks. Stays on the ground or in low vegetation, constantly bobbing its rear end up and down. During the breeding season, favors steeper ravines with hemlocks and fast-moving water with lots of rocks to hop on.

Its brown plumage and bold streaking help explain why this member of the warbler family has the word “thrush” in its name. At all seasons, this species stays close to moving water—especially forested streams and creeks—and bobs its rear end almost constantly. In both spring and fall, Louisiana Waterthrushes are among the earliest migrant warblers."
MacGillivray's Warbler,macwar,"Chunky, skulking warbler that favors dense undergrowth. Yellow with blue-gray head and chest. Blacker lores set off distinctive white arcs above and below eye. Olive-green above and yellow belly. Bright pink legs. Adult males show most contrasting plumage. Females and immatures duller but with same pattern. Found in thickets, clearcuts, clearings in mixed forests, and riparian zones. Similar to Mourning Warbler, but little range overlap during breeding season and migraton, and note longer tail and white eye-arcs.

Don’t look for this species in open forests, but look for it instead in almost any sort of dense thicket, shrubbery, willows, or low tangles along wooded streams. In these areas it forages inside the vegetation, gleaning insects from foliage and from the ground."
Magnolia Warbler,magwar,"Breeding males are striking with black mask, white eyebrow, gray crown, white wing patch, and yellow throat and breast with necklace of black streaks. In fall, their color pattern is more diffuse gray and yellow. Always look for tail pattern from below: basal half is white, tip is black. Forages for insects in forested areas.

The female lacks the male's bold accoutrements, instead wearing an elegant white eyering on her gray head, 2 thin white wingbars, and yellow underparts with moderate streaking. These boreal warblers breed in dense stands of conifers and stop off in all types of forests during migration, where they forage at the tips of branches."
Mallard,mallar3,"The quintessential duck within most of its range, found anywhere with water, including city parks, backyard creeks, and various wetland habitats. Males have a green head, chestnut breast, and gray body. Females are mottled brown with orange and black splotches on the bill. White wingbars on the front and trailing sides of the blue wing patch are bolder compared to those on American Black Duck and Mottled Duck.

Perhaps the most familiar of all ducks, Mallards occur throughout North America and Eurasia in ponds and parks as well as wilder wetlands and estuaries. The male’s gleaming green head, gray flanks, and black tail-curl arguably make it the most easily identified duck. Mallards have long been hunted for the table, and almost all domestic ducks come from this species."
Marsh Wren,marwre,"Habitat is the best clue for identifying this wren; rarely strays from cattail marshes and rushes for breeding. Migrants occasionally move into wet fields. Often difficult to see well as it skulks through grasses. Its plumage is rather bright rufous with darker brown cap, contrasting whitish eyebrow and throat, and black-and-white stripes on back.

It sings a rapid-fire gurgling, trilling, and buzzy song from the depths of the marsh where its secretive life unfolds. Under the cover of reeds, males build multiple nests and breed with more than one female. They also destroy eggs and nestlings of other Marsh Wrens and marsh-nesting birds."
Merlin,merlin,"Small and fierce falcon. Dark above and paler below, with streaking on the underparts; darkness of plumage varies geographically. Feeds mainly on birds captured in flight. Found in a variety of habitats from grasslands, open forests, and especially coastal areas with shorebirds. In flight, note powerful flight, pointed wings, and quick, continuous wingbeats.

They are powerful fliers, but you can tell them from larger falcons by their rapid wingbeats and overall dark tones. Medieval falconers called them “lady hawks,” and noblewomen used them to hunt Sky Larks. Merlin populations have largely recovered from twentieth-century declines, thanks to a ban on the pesticide DDT and their ability to adapt to life around towns and cities."
Mountain Bluebird,moublu,Adult males are stunning: completely electric turquoise blue with limited white belly. Females are gray with blue wings and tail; some can show a rufous wash on breast.

They’re a perfect combination of familiarity, conspicuousness, and style: a shade of red you can’t take your eyes off. Even the brown females sport a sharp crest and warm red accents. Cardinals don’t migrate and they don’t molt into a dull plumage, so they’re still breathtaking in winter’s snowy backyards. In summer, their sweet whistles are one of the first sounds of the morning."

In addition to the typical blue-gray bird with two dark wingbars, you'll often see flocks with plain, spotted, pale, or rusty-red birds in them. Introduced to North America from Europe in the early 1600s, city pigeons nest on buildings and window ledges. In the countryside they also nest on barns and grain towers, under bridges, and on natural cliffs."
Rock Wren,rocwre,"True to its name, prefers rocky areas, especially rocky slopes. Often perches conspicuously and bobs up and down. Pale grayish wren with whitish throat, buffy sides, and long, slightly decurved bill. Tiny speckles on back and wings like grains of sand. Undertail coverts barred black and white. Paler overall than Canyon Wren with a pale, buffy belly. Listen for its ringing vocalization. Sexes alike.

Rock Wrens constantly hop around rocks, investigating crannies for insects and spiders, which they extract with their delicate bills. This resourceful species thrives even in bleak desert settings occupied by few other birds. Listen for their loud, burry, songs and calls with repeated phrases. Northern and higher-elevation populations move southward, or downslope, for winter."
Ruby-throated Hummingbird,rthhum,"Only species of hummingbird that breeds in eastern U.S. and Canada. Found in a variety of wooded and brushy habitats. Males have red-and-black throat, greenish upperparts, dingy whitish belly, and dark tail. Females are green above and whitish below, lacking buffy-orange tones underneath.

These brilliant, tiny, precision-flying creatures glitter like jewels in the full sun, then vanish with a zip toward the next nectar source. Feeders and flower gardens are great ways to attract these birds, and some people turn their yards into buzzing clouds of hummingbirds each summer. Enjoy them while they’re around; by early fall they’re bound for Central America, with many crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight."
Ruby-crowned Kinglet,ruckin,"Plain olive with uneven white eyering and white wingbars. Males have red crown patch, but it's often hidden. Breeds in tall, dense conifer forests.

Alas, the male’s brilliant ruby crown patch usually stays hidden—your best chance to see it is to find an excited male singing in spring or summer."
Ruddy Duck,rudduc,"Small, compact duck with a long, fan-shaped tail, often held sticking up out of water. Breeding males have a chestnut body, black cap, white cheek, and baby-blue bill. Winter males have a brown body, black cap and white cheek. Females and immature males are brown overall with a dark cap and dark line through the cheek. Often in tight groups bobbing like corks on ponds and bays. Dives to forage on aquatic invertebrates. Not often seen flying.

They live among sagebrush and other shrubs, where they forage mostly on the ground for insects and seeds. In early summer, males sing an abrupt, lively song from the shrub tops, where their soft gray upperparts complement the muted, gray-green sage. These sparrows depend on intact, relatively undisturbed tracts of sage for their breeding success; they winter in desert scrub and grasslands in the Southwest and Mexico."
Sage Thrasher,sagthr,"The smallest thrasher; crisp black streaking on underparts unlike most other western thrashers. Grayish brown with buffy wash on belly and sides and thin white wingbars. Long tail. Small, slightly downcurved bill. In flight, look for white corners on tail. True to its name, shows a strong affinity for sagebrush.

They breed in the north and the mountainous West, but they become very widespread during migration."
Tree Swallow,treswa,"Common and widespread swallow that is found in a variety of open habitats like fields and wetlands. Adults are iridescent blue-green above (dark in poor light) and bright white below; immatures are duller. They forage on the wing for insects, often giving cheery gurgling calls. Nests in cavities, especially bluebird boxes.

They chase after flying insects with acrobatic twists and turns, their steely blue-green feathers flashing in the sunlight. Tree Swallows nest in tree cavities; they also readily take up residence in nest boxes. This habit has allowed scientists to study their breeding biology in detail, and makes them a great addition to many a homeowner’s yard or field."
Trumpeter Swan,truswa,"Huge white bird with long neck and all-black bill. Immatures dusky gray-brown with pink on bill. Forages in shallow, vegetated wetlands reaching under the water for plants, and walks through corn stubble. Breeds in freshwater marshes and ponds. Winters on any open body of water where food is available. Extremely similar to Tundra Swan, but never shows yellow on bill. Also, note subtle features of face: facial skin is relatively broad where it meets eye, so the eye doesn't stand out, and border between white face and black bill is straight (curved on Tundra). From head-on, the border of the bill and forehead is usually pointed (straight or curved on Tundra). Often in pairs or family groups. Almost went extinct in early 20th century, but population has rebounded and been reintroduced to some areas.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/59954771/900,NA,White,Cygnus buccinator,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Swans,Lakes and Ponds,Plants,Ground,Dabbler,Low Concern,"Trumpeter Swans demand superlatives: they’re our biggest native waterfowl, stretching to 6 feet in length and weighing more than 25 pounds - almost twice as massive as a Tundra Swan. Getting airborne requires a lumbering takeoff along a 100-yard runway. Despite their size, this once-endangered, now recovering species is as elegant as any swan, with a graceful neck and snowy-white plumage. They breed on wetlands in remote Alaska, Canada, and the northwestern U.S., and winter on ice-free coastal and inland waters."
Tufted Titmouse,tuftit,"Common backyard bird in the eastern U.S. Look for its overall gray plumage with paler underparts and orangey sides. Crest is gray, but forehead is black.

The large black eyes, small, round bill, and brushy crest gives these birds a quiet but eager expression that matches the way they flit through canopies, hang from twig-ends, and drop in to bird feeders. When a titmouse finds a large seed, you’ll see it carry the prize to a perch and crack it with sharp whacks of its stout bill."
Tundra Swan,tunswa,"Huge white bird with a long elegant neck. North American “Whistling” Tundras have a mostly black bill, with a yellow spot near the eye; Eurasian “Bewick’s” have a more evenly divided black-and-yellow bill. Immatures dusky gray-brown with pink on bill. Easily confused with Whooper and Trumpeter Swans where their ranges overlap; see those species’s accounts. Breeds on ponds and tundra in far north. Winters in large flocks on fresh or saltwater. Forages in shallow, vegetated wetlands, reaching under the water for plants, and walks through corn stubble.

A characteristic whistling in their wings led Meriwether Lewis to call them “whistling swans,” a name still in use. These elegant creatures - slightly smaller than our other native species, the Trumpeter Swan - nest on arctic tundra and visit the U.S. only on migration and in winter. Most have a smudge of yellow at the base of their black bill, but otherwise are pure white."
Veery,veery,"Warm-colored thrush, with bright reddish-brown tones above, buffy breast, and white belly. Spots are indistinct and washed out, concentrating on upper breast. Beautiful song is cascading spiral of flute-like notes. Found in a variety of wooded habitats, often favoring wetter areas.

It’s a great bird to learn by ear, because its fast, rollicking song is its most distinctive feature. Otherwise, Warbling Vireos are fairly plain birds with gray-olive upperparts and white underparts washed with faint yellow. They have a mild face pattern with a whitish stripe over the eye. They stay high in deciduous treetops, where they move methodically among the leaves hunting for caterpillars."
Western Bluebird,wesblu,"Adult males have dark blue head, back, and wings. Breast and sides are deep orange with orange sometimes bleeding onto back. Females are grayer overall with orange on breast, blue usually restricted to wings and tail. Favors fields with some trees and open woods. Often in small groups.

Along with its close relative, the Clark’s Grebe, it’s renowned for a ballet-like courtship display in which male and female “run” across the water in synchrony, their long necks curved in an S-shape. These waterbirds rarely come ashore, instead taking long dives to catch fish and other aquatic animals."
Western Kingbird,weskin,"Fairly large flycatcher, barely smaller than a robin. Favors open habitats with tall shrubs and trees. Usually seen on an obvious perch. Most similar to Cassin's Kingbird, with a gray head and yellow belly. Cassin's is not as widespread. Western is separated by paler gray head that fades to whiter throat and breast.

Yellow-bellied Flycatcher,yebfly,"Small flycatcher, extremely similar to several other species. Generally shy and inconspicuous; breeds in spruce forests often near boggy areas. Migrants tend to be found in denser wet areas within woods. Olive-greenish above with distinctive yellow wash on throat and belly. Black wings with bold white wingbars. Nearly identical to Pacific-slope and Cordilleran Flycatchers, but no range overlap. Within range, main confusion species is Least Flycatcher. Bright yellow throat and belly is usually enough to identify Yellow-bellied Flycatcher, but some worn birds can be very similar. Song is similar to Least Flycatcher (",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/160814931/900,NA,Green,Empidonax flaviventris,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Flycatchers,Forests,Insects,Ground,Flycatching,Low Concern,"Perhaps one of the easier flycatchers to identify in the notoriously difficult Empidonax genus, the Yellow-bellied Flycatcher sports yellowish underparts and a bold eyering, unlike others in the family. It is a bird of the boreal forests and bogs where its yellowish belly seems to disappear on its breeding grounds. But its abrupt and harsh song, sung with gusto, betrays its whereabouts. On its Mexican and Central American wintering grounds listen for a soft rising call."
Yellow-bellied Sapsucker,yebsap,This woodpecker specializes in drilling rows of sap wells into tree bark. Eats insects attracted to the sap. Larger than Downy Woodpecker and smaller than Hairy; often looks disheveled compared to these species. Look for the vertical white stripe on the shoulder. Adult males show red cap and throat; females have red cap and white throat; and juveniles are messy brownish-gray overall. Nests in cavities.,https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/65051951/900,NA,Black,Sphyrapicus varius,Piciformes,Picidae,Woodpeckers,Forests,Insects,Cavity,Bark Forager,Low Concern,"On a walk through the forest you might spot rows of shallow holes in tree bark. In the East, this is the work of the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, an enterprising woodpecker that laps up the leaking sap and any trapped insects with its specialized, brush-tipped tongue. Attired sharply in barred black-and-white, with a red cap and (in males) throat, they sit still on tree trunks for long intervals while feeding. To find one, listen for their loud mewing calls or stuttered drumming."
Yellow-headed Blackbird,yehbla,"Males black with yellow head and white patch on the wing. Females all dark brown with some yellow on head and breast. Breeds in marshes. Often in flocks with other blackbirds in winter, foraging on the ground. Grating, mechanical song.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/67376561/900,NA,Black,Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Blackbirds,Marshes,Insects,Shrub,Ground Forager,Low Concern,"With a golden head, a white patch on black wings, and a call that sounds like a rusty farm gate opening, the Yellow-headed Blackbird demands your attention. Look for them in western and prairie wetlands, where they nest in reeds directly over the water. They’re just as impressive in winter, when huge flocks seem to roll across farm fields. Each bird gleans seeds from the ground, then leapfrogs over its flock mates to the front edge of the ever-advancing troupe."
Yellow Warbler,yelwar,"Typically yellow overall, but some immatures can be almost completely gray. Some have reddish-brown streaks below. Always looks uniform and plain-faced. Forages for insects in wooded and shrubby areas, often fairly low to the ground. Favors riparian habitats, edges of ponds, marshes, and woods, particularly where willows are present. Winters in Central America.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/64802871/900,"NA,SA",Yellow,Setophaga petechia,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Warblers,Open Woodlands,Insects,Shrub,Foliage Gleaner,Low Concern,"North America has more than 50 species of warblers, but few combine brilliant color and easy viewing quite like the Yellow Warbler. In summer, the buttery yellow males sing their sweet whistled song from willows, wet thickets, and roadsides across almost all of North America. The females and immatures aren’t as bright, and lack the male’s rich chestnut streaking, but their overall warm yellow tones, unmarked faces, and prominent black eyes help pick them out."
Yellow-rumped Warbler,yerwar,"One of the most common and widespread warblers. Breeds in forested areas with at least some conifers. Found in open woods and shrubby areas during migration and winter, including coastal vegetation, parks, and residential areas. Forages for insects, often sallying out to snatch them in midair. Also eats berries in winter. Often travels in large flocks. Two subspecies: ",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/66119101/900,NA,Black,Setophaga dominica,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Warblers,Forests,Insects,Tree,Bark Forager,Low Concern,"The well-named Yellow-throated Warbler shows off its bright yellow throat in the canopy of forests in the southeastern United States. It hops up branches, working its way high into the canopy probing for insects in crevices and clumps of pine needles, much like a Brown Creeper or Black-and-white Warbler. Unlike those birds, the Yellow-throated Warbler is gray above with a black triangle below its eye and a white eyebrow. It is also one of the few warblers that can be found during the winter in the U.S."
Yellow-throated Vireo,yetvir,"Bright yellow throat and prominent yellow eyering set this vireo apart. Grayish above with bold white wingbars. Burry song phrases ring through the canopy of deciduous woodlands; often favors tall trees near water. Thick, slightly hooked bill characteristic of vireos helps separate this species from Pine Warbler. Winters in Central and South America.",https://test.cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/65760791/900,"NA,SA",Yellow,Vireo flavifrons,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireos,Open Woodlands,Insects,Tree,Foliage Gleaner,Low Concern,"A bird of open deciduous forests and edges, the Yellow-throated Vireo is one of the most colorful member of its family. Not only does this bird have a bright yellow throat, it looks as if it’s wearing bright yellow spectacles. This small heavyset songbird slowly hops through the canopy picking insects off branches and twigs. Males sing a burry three eight, on repeat throughout the day. Females join the males with a harsh scolding chatter during aggressive encounters."

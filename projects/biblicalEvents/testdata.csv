The 3rd chapter of Genesis tells us the story of how the serpent tempted Eve to eat the fruit from the forbidden tree. Eve found the fruit good and shared this with Adam. This action was the first disobedience recorded in the Bible. (Genesis 3:1-24 KJV) After disobeying God, Adam and Eve were cast out from the garden of Eden.

Cain offered fruits from the ground, while Abel offered selected fat firstlings from his sheep. The Lord God respected Abel’s offering but did not accept Cain’s. This made Cain’s countenance fall and his jealousy grew as time passed. One day, Cain invited Abel over to his field and slew him there thinking that his crime would be concealed (Genesis 4:3-8 KJV). Due to his actions, Cain was banished and fled to the land of Nod, east of Eden. Though he was cast out from the land where he shed his brother’s blood, God’s mercy was still with Cain.

He was born to Lamech when Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two years old (Genesis 5:28 KJV). Adam lived until Lamech was fifty-eight or just one hundred sixty-four years before Noah was born. The Bible describes Noah as a “just man and perfect in his generations”, and says he had even walked with God (Genesis 6:9 KJV). At the age of five hundred, Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth Genesis 5:32 KJV). Genesis chapter 6 tells us that God wants to destroy all living flesh he created and regrets creating them. However, Noah found grace in the eyes of God. (Genesis 6:8 KJV). God then commissioned Noah to build an ark.. Noah built a huge ark exactly as God instructed him and brought with him his sons, wife, his sons’ wives. And a pair of each living creature (Genesis 6:14-22 KJV) and seven of those that are clean beasts, male and female (Genesis 7:2 KJV). After the flood had subsided, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. He got drunk and was uncovered inside his tent Genesis 9:20 KJV). Ham, the youngest of his sons, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers about this. Shem and Japheth took a garment and walked backwards to avoid seeing their father’s nakedness and approached their father to cover his nakedness (Genesis 9:23 KJV). Noah woke up from his wine and knew what had happened. He cursed Canaan, youngest son of Ham, saying “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shell he be unto his brethren” (Genesis 9:25 KJV). And unto Shem and Japheth, Noah said: “Blessed be the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant” (Genesis 9:26-27 KJV).",11.png

He is considered to be the eldest since he is always first Whenever the Bible mentions the names of sons the Sons of Noah. After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. Getting drunk, Noah was witnessed by Ham, the youngest son, naked inside his tent. Instead of aiding his father, Ham went to his brothers and told what he saw. Shem and Japheth took a garment and approached their father backwards to avoid seeing their father’s nakedness. Noah woke up from the wine and knew what happened. Noah said, “Blessed be the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant” (Genesis 9:26-27 KJV).",12.png
Ham,BC,2447,Torah; Bible,"Ham, brother of Shem and Japeth, was born when Noah was five hundred years old (Genesis 5:32 KJV). He is also one of those who survived the great flood since he was in the ark with his father. The Biblical Timeline charts Ham’s birth in 2450, when Noah, his father was five hundred years old. The Bible doesn’t say the total number of years of Ham’s existence. The name Ham in Hebrew origin means “warm” or “hot”. In Egypt, Ham means “black”. We have also considered the Egyptian meaning of Ham since Egypt is Mizraim in the Bible and Mizraimis Ham’s son. Ham is the father of Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan, whom Noah cursed after Ham did not aid his father when he was drunk and naked (Genesis 9:22 KJV). After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. Noah got drunk and was naked in his tent. Ham witnessed his father nakedness and told his brother about it.

The Flood,BC,2348,Torah; Bible,"Genesis 6:1-7 tells us why God decided to destroy all creation with the flood. The Bible reads “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Genesis 6:6 KJV). Man’s “wickedness” was not profoundly explained in the Bible. However, we can generalize that sin was rampant during those days. One of man’s wickedness described was the unholy union of sons of God and daughters of men. It is believed that the “sons of God” and the “daughters of men” are referring to the descendants of Seth and Cain respectively. We can also assume that man had forgotten to burn offerings unto the Lord since burnt offerings were done during the time of Adam and after the flood. Nevertheless, God repented creating man on the earth. However, Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord (Genesis 6:8 KJV). God warned Noah about the destruction coming and commanded Noah to build an ark giving specific details (Genesis 6:14-16 KJV): Noah made the ark just like God described it. God then commanded Noah to gather one pair of every kind of creature and keep them alive. Also, he was to gather seven pairs of clean beasts. Genesis 7 describes how the flood took place. It was in the six-hundredth years of Noah’s life when the flood finally came. Seven days prior, God commanded Noah to get inside the ark together with his wife, sons, sons’ wives, and all the creatures God commanded Noah to gather. On the seventeenth day of the second month of the six-hundredth year of Noah’s life (2348 on the Bible Timeline Chart), the rain poured and the windows of heaven were opened (Genesis 7:11 KJV). The rain continued pouring over the earth for forty days and forty nights. And this killed all creatures, not on the ark.",15.png
Duration of the Flood,BC,2347,Torah; Bible,"The flood lasted for one hundred and fifty days (Genesis 7:24 KJV). On the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the six-hundredth year of Noah’s existence, the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. The waters continually subsided until the tenth month (Genesis 8:4-5 KJV). On the six hundredth and first year of Noah’s existence, on the first day of the first month, the covering of the ark was removed and Noah saw that the face of the ground was dry (Genesis 8:13 KJV). On the twenty-seventh day of the second month of that same year, God spoke to Noah and commanded him, his wife, his sons, his sons’ wives and all other creatures to be fruitful so that the earth would be filled again (Genesis 8:14-19 KJV). Noah then built an altar unto the Lord and took all the clean beasts and fowls and gave burnt offerings unto the Lord. God smelled the sweet savour and said in His heart that never again would he curse the earth for man’s sake. In Genesis 9:8-11 God said to Noah and his sons, “And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and every living creature that is with you… neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.” As a token of that covenant, a rainbow would be present after it rains to remind God of his everlasting covenant (Genesis 9:12-17 KJV).",16.png

It is said that Arphaxad dwelt in Mesopotamia and is the forefather of Chaldeans.",17.png

The Crucifixion of Christ,AD,30,Bible,"As Jesus traveled and preached, he angered the Roman rulers, who feared that he was provoking unrest among the people and planning a revolution. He was also feared by Jewish leaders because he challenged traditional authority and teachings. Jesus named hypocrisy where he saw it and urged his community to claim a new prophetic vision. Those who opposed him saw him as a dangerous upstart who wanted to form a cult around himself. Jesus was well aware of these charges against him by political and religious authorities, and he predicted that he would be attacked and persecuted. After a teaching ministry of perhaps three years, Jesus went to Jerusalem to observe the Jewish holiday of Passover. There he warned those closest to him of his coming death and gathered them together for a meal that would be their last supper together. He was then betrayed to the Roman authorities by Judas, one of his followers, and was captured. He was denounced by the Jewish high priest as a blasphemer who claimed to be the Messiah. Taken before the Roman authorities, Jesus was charged with sedition and executed by the Roman practice of crucifixion, being nailed to a cross. It was Friday and burial rites would have to wait until the Sabbath was over. Early Sunday morning, according to all Gospel accounts, some of the women who had followed Jesus went to his tomb to prepare his body for a proper burial. When they arrived, they discovered that the stone at the entry to the tomb had been rolled away and the tomb was empty. According to the synoptic Gospels, a figure in dazzling white appeared and told the women that Jesus had been raised from the dead. In John’s account, a man who seemed to be the gardener appeared to Mary Magdalene and spoke to her by name; it was Jesus. Although their accounts differ, the Gospels report that in the following days, many of the disciples saw Jesus and experienced his presence. This experience of the living Christ is at the heart of the Christian faith.",47.png

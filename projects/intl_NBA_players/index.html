    <p>
     The sport of basketball is becoming more of a global game every single year. As television and social media's influence grows internationally, players from Europe are entering the National Basketball Association rapidly. Whether it be by being drafted in the lottery, developing in the G-League, or through highlight plays in FIBA and the Olympics, there are several avenues for European players to make their name known in the NBA.
    </p>
    <h2 style = "text-align:center; color:steelblue"><bold>Insights:</bold></h2>
    <p>After analyzing the three different data variables we collected for all European players, both obvious and surprising discoveries were made clear through our visualization. Looking at our Geomap, it is logical to say that Western and Southern Europe is the source of the majority of European NBA players. Eastern Europe would be far behind without Russia, and Northern Europe has no chance of catching up to the rest of the continent. Moving onto our Multi-Line Graph, France dominates in terms of players and salaries earned from the NBA. However, when looking at the minutes of each country there are drastic changes around every 5 years, leaving three main averages: ~30, ~15, and ~5. Countries with fewer but great players have a higher average as they are the only players measured, this notion is led by England's OG Annunoby and Finland's Lauri Markannen. Countries with an abundance of players who are less skilled end up seeing the floor less and therefore have a lower average, this describes countries like Serbia and Georgia. The trend of "more players, more money" is relatively followed, however, there are cases where a country with fewer players has economically benefited more than others. This is due to the quality of their players being higher than others. For example, Germany's Dirk Nowitzki single handedly carried the country to third in terms of salary. Spain is also known for its collection of well-rounded players places them relatively close to France economically. Starting in 2005, some countries reached the double digit mark on European players because of the NBA's decision to ban highschool players entering the draft. The year 2016 had the largest increase due to a record setting 26 international players being drafted. Finally, the Pie Chart provides a simplistic breakdown of NBA players with France, Serbia and Croatia leading the way. There are two main groupings of countries in the 14 to 11 range and 2 to 1 range. In conclusion, from 1980 to 2022 France has been the gold standard when it comes to producing European NBA players who excel in games and earn the most money. This trend is likely to continue as French teenage phenom Victor Wembanyama looks to be the greatest NBA draft prospect ever!</p>

    <p>We hope to bring light to the outstanding development of basketball talent growing outside of the United States. While there have been over 500 international players in the history of the NBA, over half of them have come from Europe. Some of the greatest players in history have originated from Europe, and we want to visualize this trend starting in 1980 to the NBA today. Our main graphic is a "Geomap" of Europe which will paint an accurate picture on the disparity of NBA players from country to country. We collected data on the salaries and minutes played for all European players, and by using a "Multi-line Graph" we have plotted each country's average salary and average minutes played. To give a precise view of a country the user can select a country to focus on by clicking on a country within the Geomap. Finally, utilized a "Pie Chart" as a simplistic yet effective way to explain the totality of NBA players from European countries.</p>

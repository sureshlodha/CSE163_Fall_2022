        Growth of Privacy Tools
    </div>
    <div class="px-20 text-xl">
        The last few decades have been a crucial time period for consumer privacy. As the internet and technology
        expanded our ability to connect
        with others, so did it expand the ability for third parties to breach our privacy. Recent events have helped
        bring to light the privacy exploitations
        committed by companies and government entities. However, these events only matter if they affect consumer
        behavior, which is the key question here.

        Google Trends Results for Privacy Tools
    </p>
    <p class="mx-5 mt-2 text-center text-xl">
        Google Trends measures relative interest in certain terms using the worldwide number
        of searches for those terms. A score of 100 corresponds to the highest interest
        level that any of these terms achieved over the time period. A score of 50 means
        half of that interest level. This allows us to roughly gauge how interested people were in tools
        that help consumers protect their online privacy.

                <p>
                    A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel from your device to the VPN provider, and
                    routes all your Internet traffic through this tunnel. Then the VPN provider
                    forwards your traffic to the website you wanted to access. They are marketed as
                    a privacy improvement in cases where your Internet access is untrustworthy, such
                    as the Wi-Fi at a hotel. But it's important to keep in mind that the VPN
                    provider itself may see your traffic, so you must choose a provider that you
                    trust not to do that.

                <label>Tor</label><br>
                <p>
                    TOR (The Onion Router) is a protocol for highly secure Internet access. It works
                    by encrypting your data with several layers, and routing it through a series of
                    nodes. Each node only undoes one layer of encryption, which makes it difficult
                    for a third party to track the path that it took since the data transmitted each
                    time is different.

                <p>
                    DuckDuckGo is a privacy-preserving search engine. They also provide additional
                    tools such as a browser extension that blocks tracking scripts.

                <p>
                    Brave is a web browser based on Chromium (which is also the base for Google
                    Chrome and Microsoft Edge) with privacy tools (like an ad blocker and support
                    for sending traffic over TOR) built-in.

                    Startpage is another privacy-preserving engine. It delivers Google search

                    traffic.

        Social Media
    </p>
    <p class="mx-5 mt-2 text-center text-xl">
        Social Media exists on the complete opposite spectrum of privacy compared to these aforementioned privacy tools.
        There are very few laws and
        oversight governing the handling of
        private information, which can lead to a gross abuse of trust by these companies. In light of the
        massive privacy scandals over the years,
        we can see that there has been very little slow down in the growth of these companies.

        Search Engines
    </p>
    <p class="mx-5 mt-2 text-center text-xl">
        Search Engines are especially dangerous to privacy with how much personal information they have access
        to. The revenue model of search engines is based on collected user search data to sell to online advertisers.
        They also suffer from a lot of
        the same issues as social media, having very limited goverment oversight. Although not as much as social
        media, nearly all search companies have been
        subject to data breaches or privacy scandals over the years. We can see that there is a slight downward trend in
        the leading
        search engine (Google Search). However it is still far and away the most popular search engine
        and towers over DuckDuckGo, the most popular privacy-centric search engine.

        VPNs
    </p>
    <p class="mx-5 mt-2 text-center text-xl">
        VPNs are one of the best tools for consumer privacy. As mentioned in the Google Trends section, they work
        by hiding your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel. This makes your internet experience more
        private, helping prevent your Internet Service Provider as well as other potentially malicious
        data farming entities from seeing what you are doing. We can see that VPN usage has boomed in recent years
        (starting in 2017),
        perhaps due to an increased awareness in the need for online privacy. Despite that,
        the total amount is still a small percentage (&#60;10%)

        We can see from the data that while some privacy tools are on the rise in the public eye,
        the vast majority not only neglect to use these services but they also
        still use services that actively threaten their online privacy, despite these events.
        If you want to protect yourself against these threats, here are some great tools!

            <a href="https://brave.com/" class="text-blue-600">Brave Browser</a> is a user friendly, privacy focused

            but it can work great in conjunction with them. It is also built on top of Chromium so if
            you're used to Google Chrome you won't be missing out on any of those Chrome features.
            <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> is also a great option, although the privacy options are not enabled by default
            like they are on Brave Browser and as a result it requires a lot more tinkering.

            in each search you give it. There is no history or log of searches being kept, and no data profile being

            that encorporates the aforementioned TOR protocol to secure your internet browsing in several layers

            just using Brave Browser + a private search engine like DuckDuckGo and maybe a VPN is sufficient.
            However, if you feel it is necessary TOR offers a level of privacy beyond all of those. It also isn't
            owned by one specific private company, so you don't have to worry about a malicious third party potentially
            trying to use your internet traffic for profit.
            Brave Browser has a built in option to enable the TOR protocol
            if you'd like to try it out without downloading a seperate browser.

## 1. Why
The purpose of our project is to visualize the arms trade America has dealt throughout the world from 2000 to 2019. Therefore, our title shall be US Arms Sales Overseas.

Questions: What countries buy the most weapons from the United States? What year did the US sell the most weapons overseas? What types of weapons are sold most commonly?

## 2. Data Design
